# nlp-app-descriptions
My first project in NLP: an analysis of app descriptions.
I took data from Google Play Store via Python package play_scraper in March 2019. 
The scraper code is inside the play_scraper_data.py file, but since play_scraper changed, it will raise an error.
My corpus contains roughly 22K app descriptions. I use them to perform some NLP tasks on app categories, such as Topic Modeling, 
Word Embeddings, Clustering and TF-IDF.
